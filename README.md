# VR Turret Defense
This is a Google Cardboard demo/game made in Unity. It's currently in development with a tutorial and other improvements coming soon. (Probably.)

You can download the APK for Android devices here: https://github.com/JoelEager/VR-Turret-Defense/raw/master/TurretAdventure.apk

# How to play
Your goal is to use the turrets to shoot the yellow balls. If one gets past you'll lose a life. After every 5 lives lost a turret is destroyed. Try to get as high a score as you can before all the turrets are destroyed.

When you're not in a turret you can fly in the direction you're looking by pressing the trigger on your cardboard unit. To take control of a turret just fly into it. When you're in a turret you can shoot using the trigger. If the turret you're in gets destroyed you'll be put back in flying mode.
